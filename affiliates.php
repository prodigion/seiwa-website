    <p>
        Our affiliates consist of great websites, communities, and organizations that share our goals and collaborative spirit, and typically cover videogames or other media. Affiliates have access to our members-only Discord community where we support each other's projects. If you're interested in becoming an affiliate and think you'd be a great fit, please <a href="https://discord.gg/tAHWTS8">reach out to us</a>!
